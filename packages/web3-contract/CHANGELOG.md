## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** The CommonJS build is gone. `lib/commonjs` is no longer built
  or published, and the package ships ESM only.

  Node 22.12 and later can `require()` an ES module, and the minimum supported
  Node is now 22.12 for that reason, raised from 22.0. A CommonJS consumer on a
  supported Node keeps working without source changes:

  ```js
  require('@beatoz/web3-contract')   // still resolves, via require(esm)
  ```

  The `exports` map uses a `default` condition rather than `import`, so the
  `require` condition matches it too. A bundler or a TypeScript setup pinned to
  an older Node resolution mode may still need updating.

- **BREAKING:** `main` now points at the ESM entry and the `module` field is
  gone; both described the same build before.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Adds an `exports` map, so only the package root and its
  `package.json` can be imported. Deep paths such as
  `@beatoz/web3-contract/lib/commonjs/index` now fail with
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. Everything under `lib/` used to be
  reachable, which meant the whole build output was public API.

- Adds a `types` field. Type resolution previously relied on `index.d.ts`
  happening to sit next to the file named by `main`.

### Fixed

- Declares `@beatoz/web3-abi`, `@beatoz/web3-errors`,
  `@beatoz/web3-providers-http`, `@beatoz/web3-providers-ws` and
  `@beatoz/web3-validator`, which it imports but did not list. Installing this
  package on its own could fail at load.

  This was hidden by the monorepo: every dependency was hoisted to one
  `node_modules`, so these imports resolved here and only here.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** The minimum supported Node.js version is now 22. It was 16.19,
  which had not been accurate for some time: several dependencies already
  required Node 18 or later.

### Added

- Declares `typescript: ">=5.4"` as an optional peer dependency. No supported
  compiler range was declared before.
