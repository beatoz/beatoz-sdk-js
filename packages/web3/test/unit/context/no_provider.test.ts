/**
 * A Web3 built without a provider has nowhere to send a request, so calls
 * must reject rather than hang or throw something unrelated.
 *
 * This lived in the integration suite, sharing a `beforeAll` that called
 * setProvider - so it asserted "fails without a provider" on an instance
 * that had one. It also swallowed its own failure: `fail()` inside `.then()`
 * throws, `.catch()` caught that throw and called `done()`, so the test
 * passed exactly when it should have failed.
 *
 * Nothing here contacts a node, so it belongs in the unit layer.
