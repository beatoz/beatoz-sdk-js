/**
 * Network configuration for integration tests.
 *
 * These tests need a reachable node and funded accounts. This file makes no
 * assumption about where either comes from: everything is read from the
 * environment. See .env.example at the repository root.
 *
 * Values that cannot have a safe default are required rather than guessed.
 * A missing one fails with the name of the variable, instead of surfacing
 * later as a signature or balance error that says nothing about the cause.
 *
 * Nothing is read at import time. An earlier version did
 * `import secrets from '../../../../.secrets.json'` at the top level, so a
 * gitignored file that does not exist after a clone took down every test file
 * that imported it - including tests that never contacted a node.
